Zcash Core 0.11.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Zcash Core](https://z.cash/) is the original Zcash client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Zcash transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Zcash on your native platform.

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Zcash-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/zcash-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/zcashd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/zcash-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/zcashd (headless, 64-bit)



### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run zcash-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Zcash-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Zcash-Qt.
